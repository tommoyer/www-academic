# Research

My research focuses on security of computer systems and networks, addressing the challenges of establishing and maintaining integrity of the systems and data being processed. Within this broad area, my interests span several domains including traditional enterprise computing and cloud computing. More detailed information about my work can be found at:

- [Vita](/vita)
- [Publications](/pubs/)

My major research thrusts include:

## Secure Data Provenance
*Data provenance* is the history of ownership and processing of data as it evolves. This history allows a user to validate the authenticity of the data, much like provenance records allow a museum curator to authenticate works of art.

## Trusted Computing

## Secure Cloud Computing
