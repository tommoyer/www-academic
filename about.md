In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, including my children Tori, Liam, and Ella. We have moved around quite a bit since I graduated from [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu) in December of 2011. We have lived in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina, and now South Carolina.
