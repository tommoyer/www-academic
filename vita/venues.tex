\section*{Conferences[Security]}
All of the conferences in this section are top-tier security conferences with the exception of ACSAC. Acceptance rates come from \url{http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/sec_conf_stat.htm} unless otherwise noted.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\tightlist
\item \textbf{IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S\&P)}

[ Acceptance Rate (2019): 12\% ]

\item \textbf{Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS)}

[ Acceptance Rate (2019): 17\% ]

\item \textbf{ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)}

[ Acceptance Rate (2018): 16.6\% ]

\item \textbf{USENIX Security}

[ Acceptance Rate (2018): 19.1\% ]

\item \textbf{Annual Computer Security Applications Conference}

ACSAC is considered a tier-2 conference that focuses on applied security. Many government agencies send representatives to this conference, making it an ideal place to network with potential sponsors in the US government, especially the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense (DHS and DoD).

\section*{Conferences[Systems]}
\emph{Note:} OSDI and SOSP alternate years with SOSP running in odd-numbered years and OSDI running in even-numbered years. The list of topics are similar.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\tightlist
\item \textbf{ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP)}

\textbf{Theme/Topics:} \emph{(From the 2019 CFP)} ``SOSP takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including, but not limited to, operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud systems, mobile systems, secure systems, embedded systems, dependable systems, system management and virtualization. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, and databases.''

[ Acceptance Rate (2017): 16.8\% ]

(\url{https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132747})

\item \textbf{USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI)}

\textbf{Theme/Topics:} \emph{(From the 2018 CFP)} ``OSDI takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including, but not limited to, operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data, embedded systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases.''

[ Acceptance Rate (2018): 18.3\% ]

\section*{Workshops}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\tightlist
\item {International Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP)}

\textbf{Theme/Topics:} TaPP is a workshop that focuses on data provenance including the following topics: provenance management system prototypes and commercial solutions, provenance analytics, querying, and reasoning about provenance, visualizing provenance information, performance aspects of provenance capture, storage, and analytics, standardization of provenance models and representations, security and privacy implications of provenance, applications of provenance in real life settings, human interaction with provenance, retroactive reconstruction of provenance, using provenance for evaluating data quality and trust in data, novel methods for capturing provenance, integrating provenance information, interoperability among provenance-aware systems, and provenance discovery.

\textbf{Note:} In odd-numbered years TaPP is co-located with relevant conferences. In the even-numbered years TaPP is part of Provenance Week, an event which includes TaPP, the International Provenance and Annotation Workshop (IPAW), and several smaller workshops.

[ Acceptance Rate (2019): 66.7\% (6/9) ]
