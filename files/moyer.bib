@techreport{NAS-149,
	Abstract = {Interactive web systems are the de facto vehicle for implementing sensitive applications, e.g., personal banking, business workflows. The requirements of these applications are at odds with the security provided by extant web services; SSL only provides weak authenticity of the web server from whence a document was retrieved. Document integrity systems support stronger guarantees by binding a document to the (non-compromised) integrity state of the machine from whence it was received, at the cost of substantially higher latencies. Such latencies render interactive applications unusable. This paper explores cryptographic constructions and systems designs for providing document integrity in AJAX-style interactive web systems. The Sporf systems exploits pre-computation to offset runtime costs to support negligible latencies. We detail the design of Apache-based server support content integrity proofs, and perform a detailed empirical study of realistic web workloads. This study shows that we can support AJAX applications by sustaining up to 1,500 requests per second on a web server while introducing reasonable latency overheads.},
